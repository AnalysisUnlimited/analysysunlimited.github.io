I am a UX Researcher with an MS in Applied Anthropology
specializing in holistic, human-centered UX research with a focus on
adoption of technology, health, and intersectionality.

I have conducted a wide range of ethnographic research and
quantitative analysis for a variety of organizations, including Fortune
500 companies, colleges, a medical practice conglomerate, a
medical research organization, small businesses, and start-ups.
Some of the projects I have worked on include: usability testing for
wearable medical tech, business development, apps for moving,
bike trails, and glucose tracking as well as DEI surveys, beverage
containers, marketing outreach, animal rescue, and digital learning
about Peru.

I have conducted both traditional and remote research with
participants and organizations in many states across the US.
