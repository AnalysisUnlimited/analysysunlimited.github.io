RE: [Position] 

Dear [First Name],

I lead mixed-method and UX research projects to guide organizations in developing innovative product designs. My Master of Applied Science in Anthropology coupled with over 10 years of experience in practicing qualitative methodology enables me to create unconventional approaches to research experiments. 
Furthermore, my expertise in [lift 2-3 skills from job posting] positions me as an ideal candidate for the role of [job title] at [company].  
During my Master of Science in Applied Anthropology, I had the opportunity to be a full-time student, which allowed me to complete several UX research projects for Fortune 500 Companies and startups. I best exemplified my strengths in building informative UX experiments during the following three projects:

I led ARMR Systemâ€™s in designing a life-saving medical device tool for United States service members and police officers. As part of my testing approach, I recruited the demographic, created the process, and ensured appropriate documentation to determine if our targeted demographic would adopt the technology. Then, I used our findings to provide the company with product development recommendations. 

I helped a Fortune 500 company decide whether or not to employ mass mailers to increase website traffic and sales. Since developing and marketing the mailers would cost millions, we needed to evaluate the return on investment regarding our targeted demographic. I coordinated with the stakeholders' representative, then led our team in considering the significant factors that influence users to visit the website. Ultimately, our research discovered that this marketing strategy would not be cost-effective, and we presented our findings to the company's senior leaders. 

My team and I helped another Fortune 500 company decide if there was a market for their digital services app. We collaborated with upper management and organized our team according to their expertise to determine if this new product would be a sound risk. We reviewed relevant nationwide statistics for the demographic, designed surveys and conducted interviews, and reviewed how this demographic utilized the apps on their smartphones. Our team concluded that the organization should wait until there was more demand for the service. 

When I set out to further my expertise in anthropology, I researched both PhD's and master's programs to discover which path would provide me with the most enriching experiences. I decided to pursue a Master of Applied Science in Anthropology through the University of North Texas because it allowed me to gain more interactive experience in UX and UI research. 
Thank you, [contact], for taking the time to review my cover letter and resume. I welcome the opportunity to join [company name], where strengths in managing stakeholder relationships will contribute to [company goal]. Please feel free to contact me via email or phone with questions or for more information. 

Sincerely,



Patricia Stadelman Urdzik
